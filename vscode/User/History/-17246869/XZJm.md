# Qarnot PFEE CI

This project is meant to develop a working POC for GitLab CI using code coverage

The actual test project is an fnmatch implementation exposed in a static
library (this is a third year EPITA project, implementation is the one of
Dorian PÃ©ron).

The GitLab CI should do all these things:

- Install all the testing environment
- Build the library **with coverage flags**
- Compile the test suite **without coverage flags**
- Run the tests
- Collect Gcov Information
- Use Gcovr to get:
  - the coverage %age.
  - the coverage data in Cobertura format
  - the coverage data in HTML format
- Expose all the coverage data to artifacts for the GitLab interface


### Notes on GitLab interface:

#### Enable pipeline widget for merge requests
This shows the coverage percentage in the merge request
with a little toast:

If not working, go to `https://<gitlab_url>/<project_path>/-/settings/merge_requests` and enable this:
