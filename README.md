# Welcome to my dotfiles installer.

To automatically proceed to the installation, run `./install.sh`

**⚠️ Every `install.sh` script assume the working directory to be where they are**

Explanation of the directories:
- `wallpapers/` : Set of wallpapers I like to use
- `userconfig/` : all the user config files like `~/.<foo>` or `~/.config/<foo>`
- `old/` : Some pieces of config I'd like to keep around even though I don't use them right now
- `utils/` : Some useful scripts for installing my dotfiles
- `laptop/` : System scripts specific to my laptop
